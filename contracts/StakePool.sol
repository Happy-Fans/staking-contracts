/**
 * @dev The StakePool contract allows users to stake tokens in exchange for rewards.
 * Rewards can be distributed in any token, be it the same token that is being staked
 * or another one.
 *
 * A fixed number of reward tokens is distributed every block.
 * This amount can be updated anytime by the contract owner and the update will
 * be effective from the next block.
 *
 * The amount of reward entitled to each user is calculated based on its
 * weight in the pool.
 *
 * The pool opens at a specific start block.
 * After the start block is reached, users will be able to {deposit} stake tokens.
 * To receive all the accrued rewards to their wallet, they can call the {claimReward} function.
 *
 * When the end block is reached, no more rewards will be distributed and deposits will be disabled.
 * Staked tokens are still withdrawable through the {widthdraw} function and pending reward can still be claimed.
 *
 * Every time tokens are deposited or withdrawn, all the pending rewards are automatically sent to user's wallet.
